# systems-toolbox-ui

This library gives you all you need for building a user interface in the browser on top of 
**[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)**, using ClojureScript and the 
**[system-toolbox](https://github.com/matthiasn/systems-toolbox)** library.

The general idea is that there is a **systems-toolbox** component that holds
application state and business logic. This component is then observed by UI components.
The definition of the UI component is basically a function that transforms application state
into a rendered user interface. Interaction with that state component then takes place via 
sending messages. This approach is somewhat similar to the one found in
 **[Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)**.

UI components can also hold their own, independent state and interact with it directly, 
should there be a need for this.

## Examples

1) In the examples directory, you can find a basic example example with some counters. This example is somewhat comparable to the respective Redux example. This example is currently client-side only.

2) A much larger example of an application using this library is **[BirdWatch](https://github.com/matthiasn/Birdwatch)**, a tweet stream analysis application that spans browser and client. There's a live version of this application **[here](https://birdwatch.matthiasnehlsen.com)**.

This library has previously been part of the 
**[system-toolbox](https://github.com/matthiasn/systems-toolbox)** library and was moved into a separate 
repository to reduce dependencies.
